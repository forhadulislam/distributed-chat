## Server setup
### 1) Node.js
The server requires Node.js to work. So if you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer you have to install it first.
Download this from here: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Link for downloading Node.js</a>

### 2) Package installation
When Node.js is installed move to the server folder and run the next command on your terminal/command line:
`npm install`

`npm install` command will install all the dependencies which are needed for the server to run.

### 3) Running the server
`node server` command will run the server after all above steps have been done. You have to be in the server folder to do this.
